*   The linear regression model uses an equation (y' = b + w₁x₁ + ...) to represent the relationship between features and the label.
    
*   During training, the model adjusts its bias (b) and weights (w) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.
    
*   Linear regression can be applied to models with multiple features, each with its own weight, to improve prediction accuracy.
    
*   Gradient descent and hyperparameter tuning are key techniques used to optimize the performance of a linear regression model.
